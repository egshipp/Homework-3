## Task 1
### a.

```{r}
?read.csv
```
We are unable to use read.csv because it deals with data that is delimited by commas, not semicolons. Instead, read.csv2 is able to be used.

```{r}

read.csv2("C:/Users/ESLil/OneDrive/Desktop/ST 558/Repos/Homework3/Homework-3/Data/data.txt")

```
### b. 
```{r}

read.table("C:/Users/ESLil/OneDrive/Desktop/ST 558/Repos/Homework3/Homework-3/Data/data2.txt",
           skip = 1,
           sep = "6",
           col.names = c("x", "y", "z")
           )
          

```
